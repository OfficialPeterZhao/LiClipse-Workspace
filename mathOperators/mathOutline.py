#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = "My " + "Name"
print(x)

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

y = 4 + 4
print(y)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 4 - 4
print(x)

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 9.55 - 9.44
print(x)

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 9 * 8
print(x)

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.

x = "jon " * 2
print(x)

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 4 / 4
print(x)

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 4.5/4.2
print(X)

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 4 % 6
print(x)

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 4 // 4
print(x)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 5 ** 9
print(x)

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

x = "jon " *** 5
print(x)
