#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

l = ("Peter" == "Dumb")
print(l)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

d = (4==4)
print(d)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

r = (4>3)
print(r)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

c = (4<6)
print(c)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

k = (4>=4)
print(k)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

k = (4<=4)
print(k)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

k = (4 = 4)
