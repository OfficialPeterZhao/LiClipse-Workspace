#string, boolean and list):


a=2

a=3.45

a="Pop"

a=False

a =[1, 3, 5, 7, 8]



#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)

a= [3, 4]

A = [4, 6]

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:

L='Poppy'


L=4

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:

m = 5

m = a

#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:

c = [3, 5, 6]

print(c[1])

#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first
#character in that string:

string = 'Peter'
print(string[0])

#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:

print(a)
